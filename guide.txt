COMPILE

$g++ main.cpp -o main

RUN using port 1235

YOU HAVE THREE CHOICES, YOU CAN EITHER RUN ONLY USING PRESET ARGS (ENDING WITH CONTINUE TO NOT USE TELNET)

$./main SpongeBob Floppy CONTINUE

YOU CAN SET ARGS AFTER RUNNING USING TELNET

$./main

THEN RUN

$telnet <ip> 1235

$BLOCK Floppy

$BLOCK SpongeBob

$CONTINUE

THE CONTINUE COMMAND ALLOWS THE PROXY TO START WORKING

YOU MAY ALSO REMOVE BLOCKED WORKS USING

$REMOVE Floppy

BUT NOT AFTER CONTINUE

YOU CAN ALSO USE BOTH ARGS AND TELNET BY NOT PUTTING CONTINUE AT THE END OF ARGS

TESTING WAS DONE BOTH AT HOME AND AT THE UNIVERSITY, CODE WAS RUN EXCLUSIVELY ON linux.cpsc.ucalgary.ca

I HAVE TESTED FOR A LOT OF BUGS, MOSTLY USING PROVIDED WEBSITES
